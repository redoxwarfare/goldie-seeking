# goldieseeker
A command-line tool for generating and analyzing strategies for Goldie Seeking in Salmon Run.

Map IDs are:
* ap -- Ark Polaris
* lo -- Lost Outpost
* mb -- Marooner's Bay
* sg -- Spawning Grounds
* ss -- Salmonid Smokeyard

Run "python . -h" from within project directory for help.

Documentation coming soon... hopefully?

### Formatting
* Strategies are notated in the form "a(b, c)": open A, go to B if A is high, go to C if A is low
* If a gusher is starred (e.g. a*), the Goldie will never be found in that gusher

### Acknowledgements
